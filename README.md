# personal-website-log

07/03/2023:
Pen and paper working. Started to create the vision and basis for my project.
I wanted my website to be more than my coding showcase. I wanted it to be MY showcase.
Achievements, moments, blogs, etc... Whatever I wanted to do with life can show here.
I think I will look back at this in the future and probably laugh. idc, I want to have fun with this.

-> decided
